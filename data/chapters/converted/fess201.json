Follow these steps: \n\nStep 1: All children of your class can play this game. Assemble in a big hall or on a playground.\n\nStep 2: Now draw 8 circles on the ground as shown in the figure drawn on the opposite page. Use a 5-metre long rope. Mark at every half a metre with a chalk or ink. Place a small nail to mark the centre. Now hold one end of the rope at the central position. Ask your friend to hold a chalk at the ½ metre mark and move around the nail holding rope and chalk together on the ground. You have drawn one circle just as you do on paper using a compass and a pencil. Draw other circles in the same manner.\n\nStep 3: Prepare 10 placards. Name them as Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.\n\nStep 4: Select 10 children in the following order and give each one of them a placard. Order of placard distribution: The Sun - tallest, The moon - smallest; Mercury, Mars, Venus and Earth (almost equal heights); Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter taller than the earlier four planets but smaller than the Sun. Now ask the children holding placards to take their places with the Sun in the centre in their orbits. Ask the child holding the moon placard to keep the hand of the child holding the earth placard always. Now your Solar System is almost ready to go into action. Now make everybody move slowly in the anti-clockwise direction. Your class has turned into a small human replica of the solar system. While moving on your orbit you can also turn around. For everybody the spin should be anti-clockwise except for Venus and Uranus who will make the spin in the clockwise direction."
