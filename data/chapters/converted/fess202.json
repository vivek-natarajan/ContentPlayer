Mark diameters (NS, EW) and 23½° angles on each face of the circles as shown on the figure. Place the circles one on top of the other and stitch along the line NS. Now there are twelve semi-circles. Let one semi-circle represent 0° or Greenwich Meridian (Prime Meridian). The 6th semi-circle from it will be the 180° Meridian. Between the 0° and 180° there are 5 semi-circles on both sides which are West and East longitudes 30° apart. On two ends of the stapled line stick pins to represent the North and South Poles. A rubber band around the model touching the EW points will represent the Equator. Two rubber bands touching the 23½° points, South and North of the EW points will represent the tropics."
