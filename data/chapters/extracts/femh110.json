What do you infer from the answers?\n17. Avneet buys 9 square paving slabs, each with a side of 1/2 m. He lays them in the form of a square.\n    (a) What is the perimeter of his arrangement [Fig 10.7(i)]?\n    (b) Shari does not like his arrangement. She gets him to lay them out like a cross. What is the perimeter of her arrangement [(Fig 10.7 (ii)]?\n    (c) Which has greater perimeter?\n    (d) Avneet wonders if there is a way of getting an even greater perimeter. Can you find a way of doing this? (The paving slabs must meet along complete edges i.e. they cannot be broken.)",
